Here are some Taipei signs and posters I find funny.

<br/>

These rules on how to behave on the metro. Political campaigning isn't allowed, but pet birds are!

This campus sign about protecting wildlife, that just looks like a giant Godzilla bird is attacking a car:

This amazing depiction of the police fight against marijuana (Taiwan has extremely strict drug laws):

<br/>

This appeal to superstition. This one isn't that funny, I just find it lovely that instead of threatening people with fines for not complying, they promise them good fortune if they do.

And finally, these amazing aristocrats from imperial China on the metro.
