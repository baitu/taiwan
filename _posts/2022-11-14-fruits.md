As some of you already know, my grandfather passed away. This post is for him. He would have been interested to know what fruits and vegetables grow on a far-away island. 

Taiwan has many of the same fruits I know from home: oranges, bananas, apples. There's a lot of fruits that to me are either very exotic, or entirely unheard of. Conversely, there's some European fruits that I haven't seen here at all, like plums and pears. 

Vegetables tend to be even less familiar to me. Many times I will look up the Chinese word and find that there doesn't exist a word for it in any of my languages.

Take a look around the market!

Fun fact: I think I've seen more green oranges, than orange oranges.

Outside and inside of a guava. Does this count as exotic? I've never eaten one before

Dragonfruit. Again, not exotic to everyone, but it was my first time personally

This shop around the corner of where I live sells dried goods, including fruits, nuts and meat. 

That's all. Goodbye Grand-papa and lots of love everyone.
