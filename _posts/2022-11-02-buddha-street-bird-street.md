One fun feature of Taipei is the themed streets where almost every shop sells the same thing. There's book street, camera street, tattoo street, etc. 

Here's some impressions of Buddha street, where you can get Buddhas in all shapes and sizes!

And here's bird street, which you can probably imagine is very loud.

I fell in love several times and almost bought a bird. 

That's all for today! There will probably be another post tomorrow though, if I find the time!
