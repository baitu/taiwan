I'm always embarrassed about my Chinese language skills because I feel like they are pretty bad for someone with a degree in Chinese studies, but this trip is an opportunity to get better!

Obviously the best language practice is being around native speakers and having to interact with them in their language. The magic of immersion is that you get better without even trying, and I'm already noticing an improvement after just ten days of living here. It reminds me of the year I spent in England as a teenager. Eventually I was having random thoughts in English and even English dreams. We'll see whether a two months stay in Taiwan is enough to have this effect.

In addition to conversations with people, this is how I'm practicing Chinese here.

This workbook is intended for primary school children to practice their handwriting. The text is called the [Three Character Classic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Character_Classic) and has been used as teaching material for children since the 13th century. In Taiwan, schoolchildren had to learn the entire thing by heart up until the 1960s. Even today it is widely used, although some of the characters in it are long obsolete and not especially useful to learn anymore.

In Taiwan some books are bound on the right, like in Japan, and some on the left, like in the West. This workbook is bound on the right.

Something else I find useful for language practice is a Taiwanese reality TV show called *Hi, come in*.

Taiwanese Mandarin pronunciation differs from the Beijing standard that I learned in uni, so I find it helpful to watch a Taiwanese series. It is also great mindless fun. 

Tomorrow I will conduct my first interview for the research project, wish me luck!!
