Today I did some sightseeing in the rain and learned some modern history. First I visited [the 228 Peace Park](#228-peace-park), then [the Chiang Kai-shek Memorial](#chiang-kai-shek-memorial-hall), then [an exhibition](#exhibition-inside-the-chiang-kai-shek-memorial) under the memorial hall. 

## 228 Peace Park

This is the 228 Peace Park, so called because of the [228 incident](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/February_28_incident) that occurred on February 28, 1947. "Incident" is a nice euphemism for the violent crushing of an uprising and the killing of 20 000 unarmed civilians.

The park has some Japanese style elements because it was originally created, under another name, by the Japanese colonizers during their 50 year rule of Taiwan from 1895 to 1945. 

If you want a simplified version of Taiwan's history through the 20th century, just remember they had 50 years of Japanese rule, then 50 years of Chinese Kuomintang rule, then they did a democratization speedrun (first free presidential election in 1996; ranked "no. 1 full democracy in Asia" in 2021) and that's where we are today.

This is the memorial monument at the center of 228 Peace Park. It's not pretty, but it isn't supposed to. It represents the destabilization of Taiwanese society that resulted from the massacre. 

You enter the monument, place your palms on the hand imprints, and look down at the water falling down the center. You feel connected to all the lives that were lost. It's very emotionally effective.

## Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Hall

After remembering the dead from the horrors of Chiang Kai-shek's regime, I found it a bit jarring to visit the huge Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Hall built to honor his memory. The two places are only a 5 minute walk apart.

Look at it. Look how huge this is. All this for one of the worst dictators of the 20th century.

Here's a simple biography of Chiang Kai-shek:

During the Chinese civil war he committed [war crime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shanghai_massacre) [after](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1938_Yellow_River_flood) [war crime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1938_Changsha_fire) and was personally responsible for about a million civilian deaths. Ideology-wise, he was indistinguishable from the Nazis, who he was [great friends with](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sino-German_cooperation_(1926%E2%80%931941)). 

None of that stopped the U.S. from backing his regime in Taiwan after the war, where he [ignored the Human Rights Declaration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Terror_(Taiwan)) for 30 more years until his death in 1975.

Anyway, here's his larger-than-life statue inside the gigantic monument built in his honor.

## Exhibition inside the Chiang Kai-shek Memorial

Despite how it may look here, there have been efforts since the 1980s to engage critically with Chiang Kai-shek's legacy. Right under the gigantic statue's feet, I visited a very well made exhibition called *The Free Spirits vs. the Dictator - Taiwan's long walk to freedom of speech*. 

![](https://mocfile.moc.gov.tw/files/202204/f56927f1-a0bc-48ef-903a-8a891d089188.jpg)

Starting in the 1940s, the exhibition works its way up to 1992, when the worst of the repressive laws were lifted. One point that it makes repeatedly, is that none of the advances in human rights and freedom of speech happened through a natural drive towards progress - that all of them were bitterly fought for and gained through the sacrifices of individual people and small groups who dedicated their lives to it. 
One particularly striking example is the activist [Cheng Nan-jung](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheng_Nan-jung) who self-immolated for freedom of speech. 

I could go on talking about Taiwanese history and everything I learned in that exhibition, but this is already a pretty long post and I need to go to bed. Here's the rest of the pictures I took at the Chiang Kai-shek Memorial. The two Chinese style buildings on both sides are the National Theater and National Concert Hall.
