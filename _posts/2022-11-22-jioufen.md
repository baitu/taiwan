Here's some photos of a trip to Jioufen I went on with another German guy!

I took way more pictures but most turned out quite bad, you can tell my phone camera was really struggling with the lighting. 

All I can say about Jioufen is that it is 20% pretty and magical, and 80% a tourist trap. They try really hard to market their town as "the place that inspired the movie Spirited Away", *however* the studio director himself has said that that's not true and that he's never even been to Taiwan! We still had a good time there... although it is a town of lies...
