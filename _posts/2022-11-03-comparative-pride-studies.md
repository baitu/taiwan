I have been asked to make a post about Pride, so here goes.

Last week-end was the annual Taipei Pride event, with the main parade on Saturday and a smaller Trans March on Friday night. Taipei Pride is the largest LGBT+ event in Asia and gets reported on internationally, so I didn't take any pictures because it felt redundant (also I was busy talking with people and having fun!). 

So what I'm going to do here is give my perspective on the main differences between Taipei Pride and the LGBT+ events I've attended in Germany. I also made friends with an American from Baltimore and we talked at length about the differences and similarities we saw between the Pride events he knows, the ones I know, and Taipei Pride. So, here's the breakdown. 

*<small>I'm going to say "the West" a lot; consider it a shorthand for "Europe and North America" or, to be precise here, "West Germany and the U.S. East coast". Experiences within a culture can be representative, but they cannot be universal. "The West" is a difficult concept in general and the way it is used in the Sinosphere is a big topic that might make it into its own blog post.</small>*

## Similarities

If you have been to LGBT+ events in the West, here is what you will recognize at Taipei Pride as being pretty much the same. 
- rainbow flags everywhere
- happy couples, throuples and quouples
- progressive political messages ("my body my choice", "save the planet"; maybe more "Free Hong Kong" than you see in the West)
- furries
- drag queens
- the leather community
- the puppy community
- cosplayers
- corporations rainbow-washing their image and handing out wasteful amounts of swag
- kink! (leashes, masks, etc)
- in general, a lot of skin
- many local NGOs, LGBT-specific and general
- large international NGOs like Amnesty International
- political parties, though I feel like they were less visible here than they tend to be in the West
- the music. It's like every queer event in the world has the exact same playlist ^^

## Differences

Here is what you will find different.

#### Ribbons

In addition to rainbow flags and rainbow clothes, rainbow ribbons were everywhere. People were wearing them as headbands, as armbands, on their bags... At the Trans March they also had them in the trans colors.

My guess is that the Pride ribbons must be related to the yellow ribbons you may remember from the Hong Kong protests, or the white ribbons you can see on historic photographs of the Tiananmen Square protests. I guess it's something specific to East Asian protest culture. 

#### Traditional Japanese furries

A specific type of furry cosplay that integrates traditional Japanese elements. Typically a fox wearing a kimono, with Japanese sandals and/or a fan. I'm sure that must be its own subculture that I just don't know the name of.

#### Less identity flags

Now we're getting into interesting sociological territory.

At Western Pride events, many people wear the colors of their specific queer identity. At Taipei Pride, we were surprised to see a high prevalence of rainbow colors over any others. There were the occasional bi, pan, trans, NB, ace or Lesbian colors, but it was comparatively rare. I did spot some pretty niche ones, like the genderfluid flag or the bear flag, but again these were rare finds. There were also very few people wearing a large flag as a cape. 

A separate but related observation is that the cis allo gay male experience was more visible, and catered to more, than all other queer experiences. This is generally a much-critiqued feature of Western queer events as well, but we both felt it was more blatant here. 

#### Less colored hair

...or, to put it another way: the socio-cultural signifiers of queerness are different. This is something on which my American friend, who has been here longer than me, has a lot of thoughts. Queer people in Taiwan definitely have ways to queercode themselves, to express and signal their identity to others, they just do it differently from what we in the West are used to, so we tend to misread each other. It's really interesting and sort of hard to pin down. 

## Objective and subjective safety

I felt uneasy about going to the Trans March alone, so I messaged a local trans org the day before. Their reply was: "Relax, it's perfectly safe!"

Taiwan is one of the safest countries in the world, with an extremely low crime rate. Violent crimes happen, of course, but mostly in connection with gangs. Homophobia and transphobia exist, of course, but they mostly get expressed in domestic or workplace settings. Getting called slurs or beaten up by strangers in the street isn't something that Taiwanese queer people seem to be afraid of. ***However***, this is me extrapolating from conversations with a handful of people so please take this with a grain of salt. 

What I can definitely say is that my personal feeling of safety was higher taking the Taipei metro home alone with my hands full of Pride merch, than it would have been in Germany.
