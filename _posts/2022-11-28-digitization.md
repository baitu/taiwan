I haven't talked much about my research project on this blog so far, for two reasons. One reason is that this is technically a public platform and I'm not allowed to "publish" my research results ahead of time, so I need to be careful with what I disclose. The other reason is that most of it is frankly pretty boring for everyone not involved in digital humanities (but, shoutout to the few DH friends and colleagues reading this!). 

My research topic is how digital humanities are done in Taiwan and how this might differ from Europe. I have mainly been interviewing scholars who do any sort of DH-adjacent stuff and asking them about their work. I have spoken to historians, computer scientists, librarians and museum curators. It's been a fun time - for me! But it doesn't exactly make for entertaining web content. 

Today however I have seen something worth blogging about! 

The curator and head of the digitization effort at [National Museum of Taiwan History](https://www.nmth.gov.tw/en/) was nice enough to give me a tour of their basement, where archivists and engineers are busy digitizing the museum's collections. The NMTH has, among other things, a very large collection of thousands of ancient maps; the largest collection of Taiwanese folk religion figurines; a collection of several thousand vinyls from the Japanese colonial era; and more. Digitization, obviously, is a process that can vary a lot depending on the object that is being digitized. That means a lot of different machines!

Starting off small, this is how vinyls get digitized. Although there are more complex techniques, the engineer in charge told us that the best results are attained by simply playing the disc on a contemporary player and recording with a handheld microphone.

A well-lit room: objects get cleaned meticulously before going through the scanning process.

Small figurines are put on a rotating plate and get lit and photographed from all angles to get not just the shape, but also the coloring exactly right.

The resulting 3D models are then reproduced using a 3D printer and painted by hand

with astonishing results!

Some of these finished objects look exactly like stone or wood, although they are made of 3D printer resin. They come in handy when working with children who get to touch and play with copies of the exhibits. I think this is a very interesting use of digitized 3D objects, much more tangible than rotating a vase on a screen - which is what I mostly associated with 3D models until today. 

All in all this was a great visit! I felt like everyone was treating me like some respectable foreign scholar, which felt very undeserved. At the research center in Taipei where I have my desk, I feel more like an intern that no one knows what to do with - a much more comfortable position. 

(I'm kidding, I love the research center)
