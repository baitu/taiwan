My plan was to watch the sunset from Elephant Mountain, but this afternoon I stupidly locked myself out of my Airbnb and had to wait for the landlady to come rescue me, so I left too late. When I got to the foot of the mountain the sun had set and most people were already coming down. Ah well! I went up there anyway. The view was still impressive. I'll get the sunset another time. 

The bamboo-shaped tower that's higher than all the rest is the famous [Taipei 101](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taipei_101) that used to be the world's highest building.
