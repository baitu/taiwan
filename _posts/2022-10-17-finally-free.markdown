Every traveller who enters Taiwan has to spend a week in quarantine. There are specific quarantine hotels for this purpose. I took the cheapest one, meaning I got a room with no window. Here are some impressions of my stay.

This was my room:

The bed was really huge and I have to say that was probably the best thing about this room. 

This is my POV for a good 60% of my quarantine week: sitting in bed watching Taiwanese TV. There was only one news channel, which is actually great for language acquisition since you get a lot of repetition.

This sign on the inside of the door reminds you that you might be fined one million NTD (33 000 â‚¬) for leaving your room.

This is how many push-ups I did each day. If quarantine had been two weeks I would probably have gotten to a hundred.

I struggled a bit with having so little space to move around. My biggest struggle though, was recovering from jetlag while confined in a room with no daylight. My circadian rhythm is still all over the place. Today I took a six hour nap in the afternoon and now I'm wide awake at 3 a.m. But I'm confident that it'll get better now that I'm out of quarantine.

That's all for today! Tomorrow I'm meeting the professor at my host institution so I'm a bit nervous but mostly excited. I'll definitely explore Taipei in the following days so there will be more interesting pictures to come!
