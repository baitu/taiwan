I live in a district of Taipei called Zhongzheng, it is one of the oldest parts of the city and I think it's just incredibly charming.

As you can see, many streets have covered sidewalks, which makes sense since it rains a lot. 

You'll also notice that scooters are everywhere.

Lots of plants, too. I especially love the big banyan trees that are very common here.

After four days living here, I'm starting to know my way around the district. I was a bit confused at first by the way street names work here. If your adress is, say, on Nanchang Road, the house probably isn't on Nanchang Road proper but on one of the many side streets that branch off Nanchang Road. The side streets don't have their own names, they are just numbered. Some of them are tiny, others are quite large.

This mosaic facade is where I live! (on the 4th floor)

I'll probably make another post with pictures of the inside. Today I just want to show you what the district looks like.

I took this picture at 17:00. It gets dark very early here.

That's all for today. So far I'm incredibly happy to be here. My research project is only really starting next week, so far all I've done in that regard is talk about my plan with the professor at my host institution, and send a bunch of emails back and forth. 

Tomorrow I think I'll go hiking so get ready for some nature pics!
