Sorry the posts cut off abruptly after the [last update](https://baitu.github.io/taiwan/jekyll/update/2022/11/30/tainan-pics.html). My laptop died a sudden and tragic death and I couldn't easily do updates from my phone.

I came back to Germany a week ago, Taiwan was an amazing experience and I hope to go back someday. The data gathering phase of my research project is done, the writing part will take up the next months. I won't be posting about it here though. I'll just leave this blog up as a repository of good memories. 

Bye everyone, take care and happy holidays!
