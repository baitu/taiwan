Today I hiked the Temple trail. Absolutely well-deserved name. Many mountains in Taiwan have a temple or shrine, but this one has a particularly high temple density. Just look at this map!

The map doesn't even list all the shrines!

100 year old banyan tree. Banyans are holy trees in Buddhism.

Shrine to Guanyin, the transfeminine bodhisattva

Wind lions always come in pairs: one has an open grin to scare off evil spirits, the other keeps his mouth closed to keep good spirits inside.

Stray dogs and cats are common around temples

Another holy banyan. It gets offerings from worshippers, hence the plate

I asked which god this temple is dedicated to; the friendly temple worker replied with a long string of names. I'm not sure whether she named a lot of different gods, or a lot of names for the same god. Either is possible in Daoism.
