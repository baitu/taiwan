I arrived in Tainan yesterday night! Tainan is to Taipei what Kyoto is to Tokyo, being the former capital of Taiwan and a less bustling, more relaxed and traditional city. 

I'm staying here four days. On Monday I will meet a museum director for my research project, but besides that I plan to chill.

In case you were wondering, not every city in Taiwan starts with "Tai", but four of them do: Taipei, Tainan, Taichung and Taitung. Respectively Tai-north, Tai-south, Tai-middle and Tai-east. I actually passed through Taichung on my way from Taipei to Tainan; it's in the middle between the two, if you can believe that.
