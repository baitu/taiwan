Longshan Temple is dedicated mainly to the Daoist goddess [Mazu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mazu) and the Buddhist goddess [Guanyin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guanyin) (who is technically a bodhisattva but gets worshipped as a goddess), as well as a host of lesser gods and goddesses from several different traditions. East Asian gods are less possessive than our Western ones and don't mind sharing their living space. 

I didn't take pictures inside because people were worshipping and it would have felt disrespectful. I made a short video to try and convey the atmosphere.

Monks were sitting inside the prayer hall leading the chant and accompanying it with simple instruments (a drum and a bell). Common temple-goers were standing, sitting or kneeling, following the chant by reading from a prayer book. There is no sermon, the service consists only of 2 hours of uninterrupted chanting.

Many temple-goers were not participating in the chant but just strolling around and chatting. The atmosphere, while devotional, is a lot more laid back than in Christian services. 

I suspect many of you are going to send me questions about Chinese temples now. Chinese religion is definitely a fascinating topic and I enjoy learning about it. So send me your questions and I will make a longer post about Chinese and Taiwanese temples down the line. 

<small>P.S. I lost sleep last night trying to find a better way to embed the video without resorting to Youtube. Send help.</small>
